# SpaceJanitor
Final Integration Project for CSC 2463

Space Janitor is a game made using p5.js with Arduino. It's a small game with a tiny
objective, which is to clean up the "evil coins" things. To do so, you must control
the in-game spherical sprite and move it using a joystick as analog input after connecting.
Colliding with the coins moves them and each one gets removed when pushed off the screen. 
Starting with 100 coins, you must wipe all of them off the screen as quickly as you can.
Score will be tracked by time indicated by a timer on the bottom left. The remaining coins 
to purge is visible on the bottom right. When that number hits 0, you win. To replay, refresh
the page and enjoy.

Analog input: joystick 
Digital output: Built-in LED on the controller board
Sound: background music, alternative mode music, coin removal sound, finish sound with additional music
Graphics: Space image, player sprite, coin grouped sprites, connect button, time indicator, coin tracker

This game was made for the grade. Currently no intentions for further development or consideration.
